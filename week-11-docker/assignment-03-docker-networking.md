# Assignment 3 — Docker Networking

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will explore Docker networking by using default bridge, custom bridge, multiple bridge, and host network modes. You will verify container communication, service discovery, network isolation, public access, and host networking on a Linux VM or EC2 instance.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Available Docker Networks

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network ls
```

The output must include the default `bridge`, `host`, and `none` networks.

- `backend` without a published host port
- `db` without a published host port

![PALLOTI](./screenshots/11wk310.png)

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Frontend Network Inspection

```bash
docker exec frontend wget -qO- http://backend
```

The output must display the Nginx Welcome Page HTML.

![PALLOTI](./screenshots/11wk313.png)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Backend-to-Database Communication

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing a successful connection to `db` on port `27017` from the `backend` container.

![PALLOTI](./screenshots/11wk314.png)

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Frontend-to-Database Isolation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing that the `frontend` container cannot reach `db` on port `27017`.

The output must include:

```text
Expected result: frontend cannot reach db
```

![PALLOTI](./screenshots/11wk315.png)

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Public Frontend Access

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page from the `frontend` container at:

```text
http://<YOUR-VM-PUBLIC-IP>
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

# Networking Notes

Write a short note explaining:

- Default bridge networking
- Container-name communication on a custom bridge network
- Why the frontend could not access the database in Task 3
- The difference between bridge mode and host network mode



Key Networking Concepts in Multi-Tier Container Deployments
Default Bridge Networking

When Docker starts without a specified network, containers attach to the default bridge network automatically.

Containers can communicate externally via NAT, but automatic container-name DNS resolution is disabled on the default bridge, requiring manual IP tracking or legacy linking.

Container-Name Communication on Custom Networks

Creating and using custom user-defined bridge networks enables Docker's built-in embedded DNS server.

Containers connected to the same custom network can seamlessly discover and talk to each other using their service names (e.g., connecting to api or db) as hostnames.

Frontend and Database Architecture Constraints

In a secure 3-tier architecture, the frontend (ui) communicates exclusively with the backend API (api), while the database (db) remains isolated behind the backend layer.

Direct cross-communication barriers or strict network isolation prevent unauthorized layers from reaching internal datastores directly.

Bridge Mode vs. Host Network Mode

Bridge Mode: Isolates containers within a virtual network using NAT and explicit port mapping flags (such as -p 80:80), ensuring clean port separation and security boundaries.

Host Network Mode: Bypasses network isolation entirely, attaching the container directly to the host machine's network stack for native performance without port translation layers.
